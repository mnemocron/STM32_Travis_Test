### Troubleshooting

#### Makefile and Windows

The makefile is auto-generated by the STM32CubeMX for the host operating system.
It will include **absolute paths** (`C:\users\....`) and use Windows style `\` backslash. This will not work on Travis.

- use the `makefile-fix.py` either locally or in Travis
